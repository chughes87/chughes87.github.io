	<h1>ðŸŽƒ Charles' Spoopy Party ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»</h1>
	<div>
		<strong>What: </strong>Hey yall, I thought I'd host a little haloween get together on my roof! There will be music, cool queers, and some food. Please wear a costume if you feel moved to do so!
		<br />
		<br />
		Bring some if you'd like! (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AXcUyayNXFka1B3ybvo_sbjT4baoBBfX992rhlOp8lI/edit?usp=sharing">food google sheet</a>)
		<br />
		<br />
		Our building has an elevator that goes from the front lobby straight to the roof. You can find my name (Hughes C) at the front door thing and call me with that. I can buzz you in from there! I will not be wearing a mask on the roof and won't require others to. Please ask others for permission before establishing physical contact.
		<br />
		<br />
		If you're planning on driving here, the most parking is usually on Northgate Avenue. Full disclosure, it would be best if you had a minimum amount of things in your car if you park there.
